    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Entity extraction is an NLP technique that allows us to automatically extract specific data from naturally written text, such as news, emails, books, etc.\n",
    "That data can then later be saved to a database, used for lookup or any other type of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classic entity extraction programs usually limit you to pre-defined classes, such as name, address, price, etc. or require you to provide many examples of types of entities you are interested in.\n",
    "By using a LLM for entity extraction, in most cases you are only required to specify what you need to extract in natural language. This gives you flexibility and accuracy in your queries, while saving time by removing the need for data labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, LLM entity extraction can be used to help you assemble a dataset to create a customised solution for your use case, such as [Amazon Comprehend custom entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/custom-entity-recognition.html) recognition."

    "- Change the prompts to your specific usecase and evaluate the output of different models.\n",
    "- Apply different prompt engineering principles to get better outputs. Refer to the prompt guide for your chosen model for recommendations, e.g. [here is the prompt guide for Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/introduction-to-prompt-design)."
